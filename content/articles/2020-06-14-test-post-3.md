Houston Rockets star guard James Harden remains absent from the team’s training camp, and first-year Houston coach Stephen Silas called it a setback.

“As far as timetable, there’s no timetable as far as I know, and it is a setback,” Silas told reporters on Zoom call Monday. “You want your best player to be here. And there’s a short window. It is a setback. I have to be honest and understand this is a setback not having one of the best players in the NBA here. But I’m working with the guys who are here, and we’re working hard.”

Houston's first preseason game is Friday.

Silas said on Sunday he has not communicated with Harden, who is entering the second season of a four-year, $171.1 million contract.

It is the second consecutive day that Harden did not participate in a team practice. Silas said Sunday that Harden, the 2017-18 MVP and first-team All-NBA guard in 2019-20, wasn’t available because of the NBA’s health and safety protocols. During the weekend, Harden posted a photo of himself celebrating rapper Lil Baby’s birthday at a celebration in Atlanta.
