W.P. Carey's dividend yield is roughly 6% today. The [real estate investment trust](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/reits/?utm_source=usa-today&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=eda5c089-b9a4-413f-9868-13ae1af5b590) has increased the dividend every year since its 1998 IPO, meaning roughly 23 years and counting. In a world where the S&P 500 Index, using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF as a proxy, yields less than 2%, this is a very attractive proposition. But it gets even better when you look under the hood.

W.P. Carey is what's known as a net-lease REIT, which means that it owns single-tenant properties where the tenants are responsible for most of the operating costs of the assets they occupy. It's generally looked at as a fairly low-risk approach in the sector.

A lot of REITs use the net-lease approach. What separates W.P. Carey, though, is its diversification. It spreads its portfolio across the industrial (24% of rents), warehouse (23%), office (23%), retail (17%), and self storage (5%) sectors, with a sizable "other" category rounding things out. Furthermore, it generates roughly 37% of its rents from outside of the United States. This level of diversification is pretty unique in the REIT space, and helped W.P. Carey sail through the coronavirus pandemic with high 90% rent collection rates.



Whether you like W.P. Carey, 3M, or NextEra Energy will really depend on the type of dividend investor you are. Those seeking to maximize current income will like diversified REIT W.P. Carey. Value-focused investors will appreciate out-of-favor industrial giant 3M. And those looking for dividend growth will definitely find NextEra energy attractive. If you take the time to dig in here, at least one of these reliable dividend payers should tickle your fancy, and highly likely keep paying you for the rest of your life.
